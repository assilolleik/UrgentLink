CHECK NOTE FOR HOW TO RUN
- **Project Overview:**
  - Developed a BERT-based Hospital Assistant for patient queries in the emergency department.
  - Utilized the MED DIALOG Chinese dataset for training.
  - Preprocessed and translated data to create a robust training set with patient queries and corresponding department names.
  - Accuracy>70%
- **Training Phase:**
  - Model demonstrated progressive learning across multiple epochs.
  - Notable reductions in training loss and improved accuracy and validation loss metrics.
  - Highlighted the model's adeptness in understanding patient inquiries and providing relevant responses.

- **Testing Phase:**
  - Real-world evaluations at Saint George Hospital involving general medicine doctors and emergency room nurses.
  - Assessments provided crucial insights into the model's practical applicability and responsiveness in clinical and emergency healthcare settings.
  - External evaluations by a general medicine doctor, independent of the hospital setting, offered an unbiased perspective.

- **Conclusion:**
  - Successful fusion of natural language processing techniques, BERT architecture, and real-world healthcare applications.
  - System can decipher patient queries and recommend relevant departments.
  - Promising tool for improving patient experience and optimizing initial steps in the medical consultation process.

- **Future Directions:**
  - Continuous refinement and adaptation based on user feedback and evolving language patterns.
  - Ensuring sustained effectiveness of the system.
